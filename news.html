                        <h4 style="font-style: italic;"><em>January 17, 2025</em></h4>
                        <p>
                            Oswiecim, Poland – On January 27th, world leaders will join a dwindling number of Holocaust
                            survivors to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau by
                            Soviet troops. This year's event is expected to be particularly poignant as many of the
                            surviving victims are in their 90s, making this potentially the last time a significant
                            number can attend the commemoration. Nazi Germany systematically murdered over 1.1 million
                            people at Auschwitz between 1940 and 1945, primarily Jews, but also Poles, Roma, and
                            prisoners of war. The liberation by the Red Army on January 27, 1945, found only 7,000
                            emaciated survivors. Tens of thousands had been forced on "death marches" in the preceding
                            months. The commemoration will serve as a stark reminder of the horrors of the Holocaust
                            and the importance of remembering the victims and fighting against all forms of hatred and
                            discrimination.

                        <h4 style="font-style: italic;"><em>January 26, 2025</em></h4>
                        <p>
                            The Kansas City Chiefs are one win from an unprecedented NFL 'three-peat' after beating the
                            Buffalo Bills to reach Super Bowl 59. The Chiefs held on for a thrilling 32-29 win over the
                            Bills to become the first back-to-back champions to return to the Super Bowl. It is the
                            fifth time in six years that Kansas City have reached the NFL's championship game, winning
                            three of the past five. They will face the Philadelphia Eagles in New Orleans on 9
                            February, in a repeat of Super Bowl 57.

                        <h4 style="font-style: italic;"><em>January 27, 2025</em></h4>
                        <p>
                            The UK's largest luxury car maker, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), says it will invest £65m ($81m)
                            to expand its bespoke paint services in response to growing demand from wealthy customers.
                            The plan includes opening new paint facilities in Castle Bromwich, UK and Nitra, Slovakia.
                            The firm, which is owned by India's Tata Group, says it expects to more than double its
                            bespoke paint operation, including helping clients match the color of exclusive Range
                            Rover SV models to their private jets or yachts. It follows a similar move by Rolls-Royce,
                            which announced earlier this month that it was investing £300m to build more
                            highly-customized versions of its cars for super-rich customers.

                            Jimmy Donaldson - aka MrBeast - was jubilant as he told his tens of millions of TikTok
                            followers about his bid to buy the platform. "I might become you guys' new CEO! I'm super
                            excited!" Donaldson said from a private jet. He then proceeded to promise $10,000 to five
                            random new followers. The internet creator's post has been viewed more than 73 million
                            times since Monday. Donaldson said he could not share details about his bid, but promised:
                            "Just know, it's gonna be crazy." Donaldson is one of multiple suitors who have expressed
                            interest in purchasing TikTok, the wildly popular social media platform that's become the
                            subject of a fast-moving political drama in the United States. Last year, then-President
                            Joe Biden signed a law that gave TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance until 19
                            January to sell the platform or face a ban in the United States.
